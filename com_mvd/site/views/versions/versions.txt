one display
1. ensure we have a MVD name
2. list the variants in the MVD. Convert them into a VariantTable
3. Convert the VariantTable into XML
4. Transform the VariantTable XML into HTML (editable or not, depending on the user)
5. As the user interacts with the form, modify the view (expanding the version or group description) and send the changed configuration back to the server for updating.
6. Remember the state of the expansion/collapse of the version table, recording the object in the session. (But don't save that information back to the model).
