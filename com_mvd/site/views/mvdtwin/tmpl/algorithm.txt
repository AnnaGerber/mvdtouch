1. find the side which has moved since the last call to the function.
2. find the span on that side, which is closest to the centre of its displaybox div
3. Find the corresponding span on the other side by its ID. e.g. if the first span is d23f the the corresponding one on the other wide will be a23f. 
4. Compute the topOffset of the first span relative to the top of the displaybox div. 
5. Compute the topOffset of the second span relative to its display div.
6. Set the scroll position of the second div to the topOffset of the span - half the displaybox height.
