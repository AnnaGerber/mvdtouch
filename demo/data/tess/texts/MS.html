        &amp; she could hear the rustling of the branches as he ascended the adjoining

        <br class="lb">
        &amp; finally died away. With the setting of the moon the pale light lessened,

        had pushed on up the slope to clear up
        <br class="lb">
        his doubt as to the locality they were in. He had, in fact, driven quite

        at random for two hours, taking any turning that came to hand in 
        <br class="lb">
        order to prolong the drive with her, &amp; giving far more attention to <span class="founddeleted">Sue's</span>
