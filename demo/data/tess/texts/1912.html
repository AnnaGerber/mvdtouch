        He turned the horse&rsquo;s head into the bushes, hitched 
        <br class="lb">
        him on to a bough, and made a sort of couch or nest 
        <br class="lb">
        for her in the deep mass of dead leaves.
    </p>
    <br class="lb">
    <p>
        <span class="said">&lsquo;Now, you sit there,&rsquo;</span>
        he said. <span class="said">&lsquo;The leaves have 
            <br class="lb">
            not got damp as yet. Just give an eye to the horse<span class="pc mdash">--</span>
            <br class="lb">
            it will be quite sufficient.&rsquo;
        </span>
    </p>
    <br class="lb">
    <p>
        He took a few steps away from her, but, returning, 
        <br class="lb">
        said, <span class="said">&lsquo;By the bye, Tess, your father has a new cob <span class="note gloss"><span class="note-content">a powerfully built short-legged horse</span><span class="note-author">Tim Dolin</span></span>
            <br class="lb">
            to-day. Somebody gave it to him.&rsquo;
        </span>
    </p>
    <br class="lb">
    <p>
        <span class="said">&lsquo;Somebody? You!&rsquo;</span>
    </p>
    <br class="lb">
    <p>
        D&rsquo;Urberville nodded.
    </p>
    <br class="lb">
    <p>
        <span class="said">&lsquo;O how very good of you that is!&rsquo;</span>
        she exclaimed, 
        <br class="pb">
        <br class="lb">
        with a painful sense of the awkwardness of having to 
        <br class="lb">
        thank him just then.
    </p>
    <br class="lb">
    <p>
        <span class="said">&lsquo;And the children have some toys.&rsquo;</span>
    </p>
    <br class="lb">
    <p>
        <span class="said">&lsquo;I didn&rsquo;t know<span class="pc mdash">--</span>you ever sent them anything!&rsquo;</span>
        <br class="lb">
        she murmured, much moved.<span class="said">&lsquo;I almost wish you had 
            <br class="lb">
            not<span class="pc mdash">--</span>yes, I almost wish it!&rsquo;
        </span>
    </p>
    <br class="lb">
    <p>
        <span class="said">&lsquo;Why, dear?&rsquo;</span>
    </p>
    <br class="lb">
    <p>
        <span class="said">&lsquo;It<span class="pc mdash">--</span>hampers me so.&rsquo;</span>
    </p>
    <br class="lb">
    <p>
        <span class="said">&lsquo;Tessy<span class="pc mdash">--</span>don&rsquo;t you love me ever so little now?&rsquo;</span>
    </p>
    <br class="lb">
    <p>
        <span class="said">&lsquo;I&rsquo;m grateful,&rsquo;</span>she reluctantly admitted.<span class="said">&lsquo;But I 
            <br class="lb">
            fear I do not<span class="pc mdash">--</span><span class="pc mdash">--</span>&rsquo;
        </span>
        The sudden vision of his passion 
        <br class="lb">
        for herself as a factor in this result so distressed her 
        <br class="lb">
        that, beginning with one slow tear, and then following 
        <br class="lb">
        with another, she wept outright.
    </p>
    <br class="lb">
    <p>
        <span class="said">&lsquo;Don&rsquo;t cry, dear, dear one! Now sit down here, 
            <br class="lb">
            and wait till I come.&rsquo;
        </span>
        She passively sat down amid 
        <br class="lb">
        the leaves he had heaped, and shivered slightly.
        <br class="lb">
        <span class="said">&lsquo;Are you cold?&rsquo;</span>
        he asked.
    </p>
    <br class="lb">
    <p>
        <span class="said">&lsquo;Not very<span class="pc mdash">--</span>a little.&rsquo;</span>
    </p>
    <br class="lb">
    <p>
        He touched her with his fingers, which sank into 
        <br class="lb">
        her as into down.<span class="said">&lsquo;You have only that puffy muslin 
            <br class="lb">
            dress on<span class="pc mdash">--</span>how's that?&rsquo;
        </span>
    </p>
    <br class="lb">
    <p>
        <span class="said">&lsquo;It&rsquo;s my best summer one. &rsquo;Twas very warm 
            <br class="lb">
            when I started, and I didn&rsquo;t know I was going to 
            <br class="lb">
            ride, and that it would be night.&rsquo;
        </span>
    </p>
    <br class="lb">
    <p>
        <span class="said">&lsquo;Nights grow chilly in September. Let me see.&rsquo;</span>
        <br class="lb">
        He pulled off a light overcoat that he had worn, and 
        <br class="lb">
        put it round her tenderly.<span class="said">&lsquo;That's it<span class="pc mdash">--</span>now you'll 
            <br class="lb">
            feel warmer,&rsquo;
        </span>
        he continued. <span class="said">&lsquo;Now, my pretty, rest 
            <br class="lb">
            there; I shall soon be back again.&rsquo;
        </span>
    </p>
    <br class="lb">
    <p>
        Having buttoned the overcoat round her shoulders 
        <br class="lb">
        he plunged into the webs of vapour which by this time 
        <br class="lb">
        formed veils between the trees. She could hear the 
        <br class="lb">
        rustling of the branches as he ascended the adjoining 
        <br class="lb">
        slope, till his movements were no louder than the 
        <br class="lb">
        hopping of a bird, and finally died away. With the 
        <br class="lb">
        setting of the moon the pale light lessened, and Tess 
        <br class="lb">
        became invisible as she fell into reverie upon the leaves 
        <br class="lb">
        where he had left her.
    </p>
    <br class="pb">
    <br class="lb">
    <p>
        In the meantime Alec D&rsquo;Urberville had pushed on 
        <br class="lb">
        up the slope to clear his genuine doubt as to the 
        <br class="lb">
        quarter of The Chase they were in. He had, in fact, 
        <br class="lb">
        ridden quite at random for over an hour, taking any 
        <br class="lb">
        turning that came to hand in order to prolong com-
        <br class="lb">
        panionship with her, and giving far more attention 
        <br class="lb">
        to Tess&rsquo;s moonlit person than to any wayside object. 
        <br class="lb">
        A little rest for the jaded animal being desirable, he 
        <br class="lb">
        did not hasten his search for landmarks. A clamber 
        <br class="lb">
        over the hill into the adjoining vale brought him to 
        <br class="lb">
        the fence of a highway whose contours he recognized, 
        <br class="lb">
        which settled the question of their whereabouts. 
        <br class="lb">
        D&rsquo;Urberville thereupon turned back; but by this time 
        <br class="lb">
        the moon had quite gone down, and partly on account 
        <br class="lb">
        of the fog The Chase was wrapped in thick darkness, 
        <br class="lb">
        although morning was not far off. He was obliged 
        <br class="lb">
        to advance with outstretched hands to avoid contact 
        <br class="lb">
        with the boughs, and discovered that to hit the exact 
        <br class="lb">
        spot from which he had started was at first entirely 
        <br class="lb">
        beyond him. Roaming up and down, round and 
        <br class="lb">
        round, he at length heard a slight movement of the 
        <br class="lb">
        horse close at hand; and the sleeve of his overcoat 
        <br class="lb">
        unexpectedly caught his foot.
    </p>
    <br class="lb">
    <p>
        <span class="said">&lsquo;Tess!&rsquo;</span>
        said d&rsquo;Urberville.
    </p>
    <br class="lb">
    <p>
        There was no answer. The obscurity was now so 
        <br class="lb">
        great that he could see absolutely nothing but a pale 
        <br class="lb">
        nebulousness at his feet, which represented the white 
        <br class="lb">
        muslin figure he had left upon the dead leaves. Every-
        <br class="lb">
        thing else was blackness alike. D&rsquo;Urberville stooped; 
        <br class="lb">
        and heard a gentle regular breathing. He knelt and 
        <br class="lb">
        bent lower, till her breath warmed his face, and in a 
        <br class="lb">
        moment her cheek was in contact with hers. She was 
        <br class="lb">
        sleeping soundly, and upon her eyelashes their lingered 
        <br class="lb">
        tears.
    </p>
    <br class="lb">
    <p>
        Darkness and silence ruled everywhere around. 
        <br class="lb">
        Above them rose the primeval yews and oaks of The 
        <br class="lb">
        Chase, in which were poised gentle roosting birds in 
        <br class="lb">
        their last nap; and about them stole the hopping 
        <br class="lb">
        rabbits and hares. But, might some say, where was 
        <br class="pb">
        <br class="lb">
        Tess&rsquo;s guardian angel? where was the providence of 
        <br class="lb">
        her simple faith? Perhaps, like that other god of 
        <br class="lb">
        whom the ironical Tishbite <span class="note gloss"><span class="note-content">In 1 Kings 18 the prophet Elijah (called <span class="q">"Elijah the Tishbite"</span> challenges the followers of Baal to dress a sacrificial bullock and pray to their god to ignite the fire beneath it. When their prayers are not answered, Elijah mocks them.</span><span class="note-author">Tim Dolin</span></span>spoke, he was talking, or 
        <br class="lb">
        he was pursuing, or he was in a journey, or he was 
        <br class="lb">
        sleeping and was not to be awaked.
    </p>
    <br class="lb">
    <p>
        Why it was that upon this beautiful feminine tissue, 
        <br class="lb">
        sensitive as gossamer, and practically blank as snow 
        <br class="lb">
        as yet, there should have been traced such a coarse 
        <br class="lb">
        pattern as it was doomed to receive; why so often 
        <br class="lb">
        the coarse appropriates the finer thus, the wrong man 
        <br class="lb">
        the woman, the wrong woman the man, many thousand 
        <br class="lb">
        years of analytical philosophy have failed to explain 
        <br class="lb">
        to our sense of order. One may, indeed, admit the 
        <br class="lb">
        possibility of a retribution lurking in the present 
        <br class="lb">
        catastrophe. Doubtless some of Tess D&rsquo;Urberville&rsquo;s 
        <br class="lb">
        mailed ancestors rollicking home from a fray had dealt 
        <br class="lb">
        the same measure even more ruthlessly towards peasant 
        <br class="lb">
        girls of their time. But though to visit the sins of the 
        <br class="lb">
        fathers<span class="note gloss"><span class="note-content">The implication is not that the innocent are punished because of the guilty: rather the ironical allusion to the second commandment (in which God threatens to visit <span class="quote">the iniquity of the fathers upon the children:</span>Exodus 20:5) only stresses that no meaning, even anger or Godly vengeance, can be reclaimed to explain Tess's fate.</span><span class="note-author">Tim Dolin</span></span>
        upon the children may be a morality good 
        <br class="lb">
        enough for divinities, it is scorned by average human 
        <br class="lb">
        nature; and it therefore does not mend the matter.
    </p>
    <br class="lb">
    <p>
        As Tess&rsquo;s own people down in those retreats are 
        <br class="lb">
        never tired of saying among each other in their fatalistic 
        <br class="lb">
        way: <span class="quote">It was to be.</span>
        There lay the pity of it. An 
        <br class="lb">
        immeasurable social chasm was to divide our heroine&rsquo;s 
        <br class="lb">
        personality thereafter from that previous self of hers 
        <br class="lb">
        who stepped from her mother&rsquo;s door to try her fortune 
        <br class="lb">
        at Trantridge poultry-farm.
