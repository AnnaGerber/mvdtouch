        He turned the horse&rsquo;s head into the bushes, hitched 
        <br class="lb">
        him on to a bough, and made a sort of couch or nest 
        <br class="lb">
        for her in the deep mass of dead leaves.
    </p>
    <br class="lb">
    <p>
        <span class="said">&lsquo;Now, you sit there,&rsquo;</span>
        he said. <span class="said">&lsquo;The leaves have not 
            <br class="lb">
            got damp as yet. Just give an eye to the horse<span class="pc mdash">--</span>it will 
            <br class="lb">
            be quite sufficient.&rsquo;
        </span>
    </p>
    <br class="lb">
    <p>
        He took a few steps away from her, but, returning, 
        <br class="pb">
        said, <span class="said">&lsquo;By the bye, Tess, your father has a new cob <span class="note gloss"><span class="note-content">a powerfully built short-legged horse</span><span class="note-author">Tim Dolin</span></span>
            <br class="lb">
            to-day. Somebody gave it to him.&rsquo;
        </span>
    </p>
    <br class="lb">
    <p>
        <span class="said">&lsquo;Somebody? You!&rsquo;</span>
    </p>
    <br class="lb">
    <p>
        D&rsquo;Urberville nodded.
    </p>
    <br class="lb">
    <p>
        <span class="said">&lsquo;O how very good of you that is!&rsquo;</span>
        she exclaimed, 
        <br class="lb">
        with a painful sense of the awkwardness of having to 
        <br class="lb">
        thank him just then.
    </p>
    <br class="lb">
    <p>
        <span class="said">&lsquo;And the children have some toys.&rsquo;</span>
    </p>
    <br class="lb">
    <p>
        <span class="said">&lsquo;I didn&rsquo;t know<span class="pc mdash">--</span>you ever sent them anything!&rsquo;</span>
        she 
        <br class="lb">
        murmured, much moved.<span class="said">&lsquo;I almost wish you had not
            <br class="lb">
            <span class="pc mdash">--</span>yes, I almost wish it!&rsquo;
        </span>
    </p>
    <br class="lb">
    <p>
        <span class="said">&lsquo;Why, dear?&rsquo;</span>
    </p>
    <br class="lb">
    <p>
        <span class="said">&lsquo;It<span class="pc mdash">--</span>hampers me so.&rsquo;</span>
    </p>
    <br class="lb">
    <p>
        <span class="said">&lsquo;Tessy<span class="pc mdash">--</span>don&rsquo;t you love me ever so little now?&rsquo;</span>
    </p>
    <br class="lb">
    <p>
        <span class="said">&lsquo;I&rsquo;m grateful,&rsquo;</span>she reluctantly admitted.<span class="said">&lsquo;But I fear 
            <br class="lb">
            I do not<span class="pc mdash">--</span><span class="pc mdash">--</span>&rsquo;
        </span>
        The sudden vision of his passion for 
        <br class="lb">
        herself as a factor in this result so distressed her that, 
        <br class="lb">
        beginning with one slow tear, and then following with 
        <br class="lb">
        another, she wept outright.
    </p>
    <br class="lb">
    <p>
        <span class="said">&lsquo;Don&rsquo;t cry, dear, dear one! Now sit down here, 
            <br class="lb">
            and wait till I come.&rsquo;
        </span>
        She passively sat down amid the 
        <br class="lb">
        leaves he had heaped, and shivered slightly.<span class="said">&lsquo;Are you 
            <br class="lb">
            cold?&rsquo;
        </span>
        he asked.
    </p>
    <br class="lb">
    <p>
        <span class="said">&lsquo;Not very<span class="pc mdash">--</span>a little.&rsquo;</span>
    </p>
    <br class="lb">
    <p>
        He touched her with his fingers, which sank into her 
        <br class="lb">
        as into a billow.<span class="said">&lsquo;You have only that puffy muslin 
            <br class="lb">
            dress on<span class="pc mdash">--</span>how's that?&rsquo;
        </span>
    </p>
    <br class="lb">
    <p>
        <span class="said">&lsquo;It&rsquo;s my best summer one. &rsquo;Twas very warm when 
            <br class="lb">
            I started, and I didn&rsquo;t know I was going to ride, and 
            <br class="lb">
            that it would be night.&rsquo;
        </span>
    </p>
    <br class="lb">
    <p>
        <span class="said">&lsquo;Nights grow chilly in September. Let me see.&rsquo;</span>
        <br class="lb">
        He pulled off a light overcoat that he had worn, and 
        <br class="lb">
        put it round her tenderly.<span class="said">&lsquo;That's it<span class="pc mdash">--</span>now you'll feel 
            <br class="lb">
            warmer,&rsquo;
        </span>
        he continued. <span class="said">&lsquo;Now, my pretty, rest there; 
            <br class="lb">
            I shall soon be back again.&rsquo;
        </span>
    </p>
    <br class="lb">
    <p>
        Having buttoned the overcoat round her shoulders 
        <br class="lb">
        he plunged into the webs of vapour which by this time 
        <br class="pb">
        <br class="lb">
        formed veils between the trees. She could hear the 
        <br class="lb">
        rustling of the branches as he ascended the adjoining 
        <br class="lb">
        slope, till his movements were no louder than the 
        <br class="lb">
        hopping of a bird, and finally died away. With the 
        <br class="lb">
        setting of the moon the pale light lessened, and Tess 
        <br class="lb">
        became invisible as she fell into reverie upon the leaves 
        <br class="lb">
        where he had left her.
    </p>
    <br class="lb">
    <p>
        In the meantime Alec D&rsquo;Urberville had pushed on 
        <br class="lb">
        up the slope to clear his genuine doubt as to the quarter 
        <br class="lb">
        of theThe Chase they were in. He had, in fact, ridden 
        <br class="lb">
        quite at random for over an hour, taking any turning 
        <br class="lb">
        that came to hand in order to prolong companionship 
        <br class="lb">
        with her, and giving far more attention to Tess&rsquo;s moonlit 
        <br class="lb">
        person than to any wayside object. A little rest for the 
        <br class="lb">
        jaded animal being desirable, he did not hasten his 
        <br class="lb">
        search for landmarks. A clamber over the hill into the 
        <br class="lb">
        adjoining vale brought him to the fence of a highway 
        <br class="lb">
        whose contours he recognized, which settled the question 
        <br class="lb">
        of their whereabouts. D&rsquo;Urberville thereupon turned 
        <br class="lb">
        back; but by this time the moon had quite gone down, 
        <br class="lb">
        and partly on account of the fog The Chase was wrapped 
        <br class="lb">
        in thick darkness, although morning was not far off. 
        <br class="lb">
        He was obliged to advance with outstretched hands to 
        <br class="lb">
        avoid contact with the boughs, and discovered that to 
        <br class="lb">
        hit the exact spot from which he had started was at first 
        <br class="lb">
        entirely beyond him. Roaming up and down, round 
        <br class="lb">
        and round, he at length heard a slight movement of the 
        <br class="lb">
        horse close at hand; and the sleeve of his overcoat 
        <br class="lb">
        unexpectedly caught his foot.
    </p>
    <br class="lb">
    <p>
        <span class="said">&lsquo;Tess!&rsquo;</span>
        said D&rsquo;Urberville.
    </p>
    <br class="lb">
    <p>
        There was no answer. The obscurity was now so 
        <br class="lb">
        great that he could see absolutely nothing but a pale 
        <br class="lb">
        nebulousness at his feet, which represented the white 
        <br class="lb">
        muslin figure he had left upon the dead leaves. Every-
        <br class="lb">
        thing else was blackness alike. D&rsquo;Urberville stooped; 
        <br class="lb">
        and heard a gentle regular breathing. He knelt and 
        <br class="lb">
        bent lower, till her breath warmed his face, and in a 
        <br class="pb">
        <br class="lb">
        moment her cheek was in contact with hers. She was 
        <br class="lb">
        sleeping soundly
    </p>
    <br class="lb">
    <p>
        Darkness and silence ruled everywhere around. 
        <br class="lb">
        Above them rose the primeval yews and oaks of The 
        <br class="lb">
        Chase, in which were poised gentle roosting birds in 
        <br class="lb">
        their last nap; and around them stole the hopping 
        <br class="lb">
        rabbits and hares. But, might some say, where was 
        <br class="lb">
        Tess&rsquo;s guardian angel? where was the providence of 
        <br class="lb">
        her simple faith? Perhaps, like that other god of 
        <br class="lb">
        whom the ironical Tishbite <span class="note gloss"><span class="note-content">In 1 Kings 18 the prophet Elijah (called <span class="q">"Elijah the Tishbite"</span> challenges the followers of Baal to dress a sacrificial bullock and pray to their god to ignite the fire beneath it. When their prayers are not answered, Elijah mocks them.</span><span class="note-author">Tim Dolin</span></span>spoke, he was talking, or 
        <br class="lb">
        he was pursuing, or he was in a journey, or he was 
        <br class="lb">
        sleeping and was not to be awaked.
    </p>
    <br class="lb">
    <p>
        Already at that hour some sons of the forest 
        <br class="lb">
        were stirring and striking lights in not very distant 
        <br class="lb">
        cottages; good and sincere hearts among them, 
        <br class="lb">
        patterns of honesty and devotion and chivalry. 
        <br class="lb">
        And powerful horses were stamping their stalls, 
        <br class="lb">
        ready to be let out into the morning air. But no 
        <br class="lb">
        dart or thread of intelligence inspired these men 
        <br class="lb">
        to harness and mount, or gave them by any 
        <br class="lb">
        means the least inkling that their sister was in the 
        <br class="lb">
        hands of the spoiler <span class="note gloss"><span class="note-content">Judges 2:14: <span class="quote">the anger of the Lord was hot against Israel, and he delivered them into hands of spoilers that spoiled them, and he sold them into the hands of their enemies round about, so that they could not any longer stand before their enemies.</span>The phrase simultaneously damns Alec and Tess's negligent guardian angel.</span><span class="note-author">Tim Dolin</span></span>; and they did not come that 
        <br class="lb">
        way.
    </p>
    <br class="lb">
    <p>
        Why it was that upon this beautiful feminine tissue, 
        <br class="lb">
        sensitive as gossamer, and practically blank as snow 
        <br class="lb">
        as yet, there should have been traced such a coarse 
        <br class="lb">
        pattern as it was doomed to receive; why so often 
        <br class="lb">
        the coarse appropriates the finer thus, the wrong man 
        <br class="lb">
        the woman, the wrong woman the man, many thousand 
        <br class="lb">
        years of analytical philosophy have failed to explain 
        <br class="lb">
        to our sense of order. One may, indeed, admit the 
        <br class="lb">
        possibility of a retribution lurking in the present 
        <br class="lb">
        catastrophe. Doubtless some of Tess D&rsquo;Urberville&rsquo;s 
        <br class="lb">
        mailed ancestors rollicking home from a fray had dealt 
        <br class="lb">
        the same measure even more ruthlessly towards peasant 
        <br class="lb">
        girls of their time. But though to visit the sins of the 
        <br class="lb">
        fathers<span class="note gloss"><span class="note-content">The implication is not that the innocent are punished because of the guilty: rather the ironical allusion to the second commandment (in which God threatens to visit <span class="quote">the iniquity of the fathers upon the children:</span>Exodus 20:5) only stresses that no meaning, even anger or Godly vengeance, can be reclaimed to explain Tess's fate.</span><span class="note-author">Tim Dolin</span></span>
        upon the children may be a morality good 
        <br class="lb">
        enough for divinities, it is scorned by average human 
        <br class="lb">
        nature; and it therefore does not mend the matter.
    </p>
    <br class="lb">
    <p>
        As Tess&rsquo;s own people down in those retreats are 
        <br class="lb">
        never tired of saying among each other in their fatalistic 
        <br class="lb">
        way: <span class="quote">It was to be.</span>
        There lay the pity of it. An 
        <br class="lb">
        immeasurable social chasm was to divide our heroine&rsquo;s 
        <br class="lb">
        personality thereafter from that previous self of hers 
        <br class="lb">
        who stepped from her mother&rsquo;s door to try her fortune 
        <br class="lb">
        at Trantridge poultry-farm.
