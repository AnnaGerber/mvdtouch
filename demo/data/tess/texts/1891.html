        He turned the horse&rsquo;s head into the bushes, 
        <br class="lb">
        hitched him on to a bough, and pulling off a light 
        <br class="pb">
        <br class="lb">
        dust-coat that he wore, spread it upon the thick 
        <br class="lb">
        leaves
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="said">&lsquo;Now, you sit there,&rsquo;</span>
        he said. <span class="said">&lsquo;That will keep 
            <br class="lb">
            away the damp. Just give an eye to the horse<span class="pc mdash">--</span>
            <br class="lb">
            it will be quite sufficient.&rsquo;

        He took a few steps away from her, but, re-
        <br class="lb">
        turning, said,<span class="said">&lsquo; By the bye, Tess, your father has a 
            <br class="lb">
            new cob<span class="note gloss"><span class="note-content">a powerfully built short-legged horse</span><span class="note-author">Tim Dolin</span></span> to-day. Somebody gave it to him.&rsquo;
        </span>
    </p>
    <br class="lb">
    <p>
        <span class="said">&lsquo;Somebody? You!&rsquo;</span>
    </p>
    <br class="lb">
    <p>
        D&rsquo;Urberville nodded.
    </p>
    <br class="lb">
    <p>
        <span class="said">&lsquo;Oh how very good of you that is!&rsquo;</span>she ex-
        <br class="lb">
        claimed, with a painful sense of the awkwardness 
        <br class="lb">
        of having to thank him just then.
    </p>
    <br class="lb">
    <p>
        <span class="said">&lsquo;And the children have some toys.&rsquo;</span>
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="said">&lsquo;I didn&rsquo;t know<span class="pc mdash">--</span>you ever sent them anything!&rsquo;</span>
        <br class="lb">
        she murmured, much moved.<span class="said">&lsquo; I almost wish you 
            <br class="lb">
            had not<span class="pc mdash">--</span>yes, I almost wish it!&rsquo;
        </span>
    </p>
    <br class="lb">
    <p>
        <span class="said">&lsquo;Why, dear?&rsquo;</span>
    </p>
    <br class="lb">
    <p>
        <span class="said">&lsquo;It<span class="pc mdash">--</span>hampers me so.&rsquo;</span>
    </p>
    <br class="lb">
    <p>
        <span class="said">&lsquo;Tessy<span class="pc mdash">--</span>don&rsquo;t you love me ever so little now?&rsquo;</span>
    </p>
    <br class="lb">
    <p>
        <span class="said">&lsquo;I&rsquo;m grateful,&rsquo;</span>
        she reluctantly admitted.<span class="said">&lsquo;But 
            I fear I do not<span class="pc mdash">--</span><span class="pc mdash">--</span>&rsquo;</span>
        The sudden vision of his 
        <br class="lb">
        passion for herself as a factor in this result so 
        <br class="lb">
        distressed her that, beginning with one slow tear, 
        <br class="lb">
        and then following with another, she wept outright.
    </p>
    <br class="pb">
    <br class="lb">
    <p>
        <span class="said">&lsquo;Don&rsquo;t cry, dear, dear one! Now sit down 
            <br class="lb">
            here, and wait till I come.&rsquo;
        </span>
        She passively sat 
        <br class="lb">
        down on the coat that he had spread, and shivered 
        <br class="lb">
        slightly. <span class="said">&lsquo;Are you cold?&rsquo;</span>
        he asked.
    </p>
    <br class="lb">
    <p>
        <span class="said">&lsquo;Not very<span class="pc mdash">--</span>a little.&rsquo;</span>
    </p>
    <br class="lb">
    <p>
        He touched her with his fingers, which sank 
        <br class="lb">
        into her as into a billow. <span class="said">&lsquo;You have only that 
            <br class="lb">
            puffy muslin dress on<span class="pc mdash">--</span>how's that?&rsquo;
        </span>
    </p>
    <br class="lb">
    <p>
        <span class="said">&lsquo;It&rsquo;s my best summer one. &rsquo;Twas very warm 
            <br class="lb">
            when I started, and I didn&rsquo;t know I was going to 
            <br class="lb">
            ride, and that it would be night.&rsquo;
        </span>
    </p>
    <br class="lb">
    <p>
        <span class="said">&lsquo;Nights grow chilly in September. Let me 
            <br class="lb">
            see.&rsquo;
        </span>
        He went to the horse, took a druggist's bottle 
        <br class="lb">
        from a parcel on the saddle, and after some 
        <br class="lb">
        trouble in opening it held it to her mouth un-
        <br class="lb">
        awares. Tess sputtered and coughed, and gasping 
        <br class="lb">
        <span class="said">&lsquo;It will go on my pretty frock!&rsquo;</span>
        swallowed as he 
        <br class="lb">
        poured, to prevent the catastrophe she feared.
    </p>
    <br class="lb">
    <p>
        <span class="said">&lsquo;That&rsquo;s it<span class="pc mdash">--</span>now you&rsquo;ll feel warmer,&rsquo;</span>
        said 
        <br class="lb">
        D'Urberville, as he restored the bottle to its place.
        <br class="lb">
        <span class="said">&lsquo;It is only a well-known cordial that my mother 
            <br class="lb">
            ordered me to bring for household purposes, and 
            <br class="lb">
            she won't mind me using some of it medicinally. 
            <br class="lb">
            Now, my pretty, rest there; I shall soon be back 
            <br class="lb">
            again.&rsquo;
        </span>
    </p>
    <br class="pb">
    <br class="lb">
    <p>
        He pulled the overcoat round her shoulders and 
        <br class="lb">
        plunged into the webs of vapour which by this 
        <br class="lb">
        time formed veils between the trees. She could 
        <br class="lb">
        hear the rustling of the branches as he ascended 
        <br class="lb">
        the adjoining slope, till his movements were no 
        <br class="lb">
        louder than the hopping of a bird, and finally 
        <br class="lb">
        died away. With the setting of the moon the 
        <br class="lb">
        pale light lessened, and Tess became invisible as 
        <br class="lb">
        she fell into reverie upon the leaves where he had 
        <br class="lb">
        left her.
    </p>
    <br class="lb">
    <p>
        In the meantime Alec D&rsquo;Urberville had pushed 
        <br class="lb">
        on up the slope to clear his genuine doubt as to 
        <br class="lb">
        the quarter of the Chase they were in. He had, 
        <br class="lb">
        in fact, ridden quite at random for over an hour, 
        <br class="lb">
        taking any turning that came to hand in order to 
        <br class="lb">
        prolong companionship with her, and giving far 
        <br class="lb">
        more attention to Tess&rsquo;s moonlit person than to 
        <br class="lb">
        any wayside object. A little rest for the jaded 
        <br class="lb">
        animal being desirable, he did not hasten his 
        <br class="lb">
        search for landmarks. A clamber over the hill 
        <br class="lb">
        into the adjoining vale brought him to the fence 
        <br class="lb">
        of a highway whose aspect he recognised, which 
        <br class="lb">
        settled the question of their whereabouts. D&rsquo;Ur-
        <br class="lb">
        berville thereupon turned back; but by this time 
        <br class="lb">
        the moon had quite gone down, and partly on 
        <br class="pb">
        <br class="lb">
        account of the fog the Chase was wrapped in 
        <br class="lb">
        thick darkness, although morning was not far off. 
        <br class="lb">
        He was obliged to advance with outstretched 
        <br class="lb">
        hands to avoid contact with the boughs, and 
        <br class="lb">
        discovered that to hit the exact spot from which 
        <br class="lb">
        he had started was at first entirely beyond him. 
        <br class="lb">
        Roaming up and down, round and round, he at 
        <br class="lb">
        length heard a slight movement of the horse close 
        <br class="lb">
        at hand; and the sleeve of his overcoat unex-
        <br class="lb">
        pectedly caught his foot.
    </p>
    <br class="lb">
    <p>
        <span class="said">&lsquo;Tess!&rsquo;</span>
        said D&rsquo;Urberville.
    </p>
    <br class="lb">
    <p>
        There was no answer. The obscurity was 
        <br class="lb">
        now so great that he could see absolutely nothing 
        <br class="lb">
        but a pale nebulousness at his feet, which repre-
        <br class="lb">
        sented the white muslin figure he had left upon 
        <br class="lb">
        the dead leaves. Everything else was blackness 
        <br class="lb">
        alike. D&rsquo;Urberville stooped; and heard a gentle 
        <br class="lb">
        regular breathing. She was sleeping soundly.
    </p>
    <br class="lb">
    <p>
        Darkness and silence ruled everywhere around. 
        <br class="lb">
        Above them rose the primaeval yews and oaks of 
        <br class="lb">
        the Chase, in which were poised gentle roosting 
        <br class="lb">
        birds in their last nap; and around them the 
        <br class="lb">
        hopping rabbits and hares. But where was Tess&rsquo;s 
        <br class="lb">
        guardian angel? where was Providence? Perhaps, 
        <br class="lb">
        like that other god of whom the ironical Tishbite <span class="note gloss"><span class="note-content">In 1 Kings 18 the prophet Elijah (called <span class="q">"Elijah the Tishbite"</span> challenges the followers of Baal to dress a sacrificial bullock and pray to their god to ignite the fire beneath it. When their prayers are not answered, Elijah mocks them.</span><span class="note-author">Tim Dolin</span></span>
        <br class="pb">
        <br class="lb">
        spoke, he was talking, or he was pursuing, or he 
        <br class="lb">
        was in a journey, or peradventure he was sleeping 
        <br class="lb">
        and was not to be awaked.
    </p>
    <br class="lb">
    <p>
        Already at that hour some sons of the forest 
        <br class="lb">
        were stirring and striking lights in not very distant 
        <br class="lb">
        cottages; good and sincere hearts among them, 
        <br class="lb">
        patterns of honesty and devotion and chivalry. 
        <br class="lb">
        And powerful horses were stamping their stalls, 
        <br class="lb">
        ready to be let out into the morning air. But no 
        <br class="lb">
        dart or thread of intelligence inspired these men 
        <br class="lb">
        to harness and mount, or gave them by any 
        <br class="lb">
        means the least inkling that their sister was in the 
        <br class="lb">
        hands of the spoiler <span class="note gloss"><span class="note-content">Judges 2:14: <span class="quote">the anger of the Lord was hot against Israel, and he delivered them into hands of spoilers that spoiled them, and he sold them into the hands of their enemies round about, so that they could not any longer stand before their enemies.</span>The phrase simultaneously damns Alec and Tess's negligent guardian angel.</span><span class="note-author">Tim Dolin</span></span>; and they did not come that 
        <br class="lb">
        way.
    </p>
    <br class="lb">
    <p>
        Why it was that upon this beautiful feminine 
        <br class="lb">
        tissue, sensitive as gossamer, and practically blank 
        <br class="lb">
        as snow as yet, there should have been traced 
        <br class="lb">
        such a coarse pattern as it was doomed to receive; 
        <br class="lb">
        why so often the coarse appropriates the finer 
        <br class="lb">
        thus, many thousand years of analytical philosophy 
        <br class="lb">
        have failed to explain to our sense of order. One 
        <br class="lb">
        may, indeed, admit the possibility of a retribution 
        <br class="lb">
        lurking in the catastrophe. Doubtless some of Tess D&rsquo;Urberville&rsquo;s mailed ancestors 
        <br class="lb">
        rollicking home from a fray had dealt the same wrong even 
        <br class="pb">
        <br class="lb">
        more ruthlessly upon peasant girls of their time. 
        <br class="lb">
        But though to visit the sins of the fathers<span class="note gloss"><span class="note-content">The implication is not that the innocent are punished because of the guilty: rather the ironical allusion to the second commandment (in which God threatens to visit <span class="quote">the iniquity of the fathers upon the children:</span>Exodus 20:5) only stresses that no meaning, even anger or Godly vengeance, can be reclaimed to explain Tess's fate.</span><span class="note-author">Tim Dolin</span></span>
        upon 
        <br class="lb">
        the children may be a morality good enough for 
        <br class="lb">
        divinities, it is scorned by average human nature; 
        <br class="lb">
        and it therefore does not mend the matter.
    </p>
    <br class="lb">
    <p>
        As Tess&rsquo;s own people down in those retreats 
        <br class="lb">
        are never tired of saying among each other in 
        <br class="lb">
        their fatalistic way: <span class="quote">It was to be.</span>
        There lay 
        <br class="lb">
        the pity of it. An immeasurable social chasm was to 
        <br class="lb">
        divide our heroine&rsquo;s personality thereafter from 
        <br class="lb">
        that previous self of hers who stepped from her 
        <br class="lb">
        mother&rsquo;s door to try her fortune at Trantridge 
        <br class="lb">
        poultry-farm.
